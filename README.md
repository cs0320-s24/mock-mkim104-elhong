To run the tests...

To build and run our program, end users of our web application must first login by clicking the login button. This will bring them to the second page, where they can enter the following commands into the command prompt:
1. load_file <csv-file-path>
2. view
3. search <column> <value>

For web developers using our command-prompt library, they can begin our program by running `npm start` or `yarn start` in the terminal. If they wish to do so, they can personalize commands within the App class.
